Accordingly, the operations of InfoSpherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and the assets held for sale of the discontinued segment are separately identified in the Company  s Consolidated Balance Sheet.   The activities of the   BioSpherix   Division continue to operate through Spherix Incorporated.    The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are unaudited and do not include all of the information and disclosures generally required for annual financial statements.   In the opinion of management, the statements contain all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the Company  s financial position as of June 30, 2007, the results of its operations for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, and its cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006.   This report should be read in conjunction with the Company  s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which does contain the complete information and disclosure for the year ended December 31, 2006.    Use of Estimates and Assumptions    The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.   This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period.   Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.    Discontinued Operations    On June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval.   The InfoSpherix segment comprises the majority of the Company  s operations.   The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division  s biotechnology products, with the principal focus on the commercialization of Naturlose.   The sale is subject to the approval of the Company  s stockholders and, if ratified, must be completed within two days of the Company  s August 15, 2007 annual meeting.       Spherix employed a business model for many years where it operated two separate lines of business    InfoSpherix and BioSpherix.   In accordance with the business plan, InfoSpherix earned enough money to support itself and BioSpherix.   This allowed InfoSpherix to grow while supplying funds for the research and development efforts of the BioSpherix Division, which focused on developing healthcare-related products.    By mid-2004, management believed that this model would soon have to change.   The product mix in InfoSpherix was shifting away from the commercial sector to a less profitable government sector.   Clients were beginning to require that the Company fund the upfront costs for information projects and recover the cost over the life of the project.   Also, our BioSpherix products were far enough along where continued development would soon require significant capital.   In addition, equity investors interested in BioSpherix did not understand InfoSpherix and its purpose.   Therefore, responsible investors were more difficult to attract.   Our InfoSpherix clients became concerned about our focus on this business and they questioned our long-term commitment to the business.   Also, our bank stated that it was not interested in funding biotechnology research.   Therefore, they required the Company to secure its line of credit with cash in lieu of receivables and other fixed assets.   Financing for capital equipment was becoming harder to attract.   As a result, at the February 17, 2005 meeting, the Board of Directors decided it was time to split the two divisions and require each one to be self-funding.   On June 8, 2005, the stockholders approved the establishment of InfoSpherix Incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spherix.   Subsequently, on January 1, 2006, InfoSpherix began operating as an independent subsidiary.                In December 2005, the FDA gave Spherix final permission to conduct a Phase 3 clinical trial for Naturlose as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes.   The Company signed agreements with independent contract research organizations to conduct the Phase 3 trial and engaged another entity to assist in the development and monitoring of the trials and to consult on FDA issues.   Although initial estimates developed by Spherix and the above consultants indicated we had sufficient capital to complete the trial, the Board and management became concerned about long-term financing.   A manufacturing source needed to be found and, should complications develop in our Phase 3 trial, final FDA approval of the protocol could result in significant additional capital needs.   In addition, it was becoming clear that InfoSpherix also needed capital to develop next generation products.    In the spring of 2006, Active Network approached the Company expressing an interest in the reservation portion of the InfoSpherix business and the Company held some preliminary discussion with the Active Network during the next few months.   On June 27, 2006, a meeting of the Executive Advisory Committee of the Board was held in Cumberland, Maryland.   The Committee discussed a potential sale of all or part of the InfoSpherix subsidiary, along with the use of funds from this sale and any settlement of our National Park Service dispute.   The Committee agreed that it was premature to make a decision as to whether any sale of InfoSpherix was desirable.   However, the Committee decided that if a sale was ever to be pursued, a sale of the entire subsidiary was preferential and that other potential buyers should be sought.    On November 17, 2006, the Company received a letter through its FDA consultant requiring additional expenditures on its Phase 3 clinical trial.   At this point it was becoming apparent that the Phase 3 trial was going to be more expensive than first thought.    Also on November 17, 2006, the Company received an unsolicited Letter of Intent (LOI) from Active Network.   The LOI was for the purchase of the entire information business.   The Board met on November 21, 2006.   After review of the LOI from The Active Network, the Board declined the offer.   Discussions were held on the need to raise more capital, even with the $6 million settlement related to the National Park Service.   The rising cost of the Phase 3 trial was discussed along with the need to complete the anti-plaque study of Naturlose at the University of Maryland.   Several methods of raising capital were discussed, but no final decision was made.    A special Board Meeting was held on January 8, 2007.   The immediate need to raise capital was discussed and the President was authorized to seek equity funding for $12-15 million to fund the BioSpherix Division.   In addition, further discussions were held to consider the possibility of selling InfoSpherix as a means of raising cash.    SC&amp H Capital Corporation (  SC&amp H  ), a consulting firm with merger and acquisition experience, was engaged on January 29, 2007, to assist the management team in exploring a sale of InfoSpherix.   On March 6, 2007, the Board of Directors created an Evaluation Committee consisting of three outside directors appointed to provide SC&amp H with guidance in the process and to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest.    During the first several months of 2007, the President met with several investment bankers about the possibility of raising capital.   It was decided that, given the current stock price and early phase of the Phase 3 clinical trial, an equity offering would not be prudent at this time.    On April 13, 2007, a Board Meeting was held to review the capital raising alternatives.   In the course of reviewing these alternatives, SC&amp H reviewed the process it had conducted with management to that point.   Contact had been made with approximately 100 companies, including both strategic and financial targets, through the use of a blind profile which outlined the InfoSpherix opportunity.   This campaign ultimately resulted in approximately 10 management presentations provided to various interested parties.   The above activities yielded four Letters of Intent, including a revised offer from The Active Network.   One of the Letters of Intent was ultimately withdrawn.   SC&amp H prepared a comparison of each of the Letters of Intent and presented it to the Evaluation Committee.   A discussion of the possible terms and requirements of a deal ensued.    Pursuant to a recommendation from the Evaluation Committee, the Board concluded that a sale of InfoSpherix was in the best interests of Spherix and the Board approved a resolution to accept the offer from Active Network as proposed.   The Evaluation Committee was given the authority to approve any changes to the LOI consistent with the discussions.                Subsequent negotiations, led by the management team and outside counsel, were held with The Active Network and on April 17, 2007, a final LOI was signed.   Detailed due diligence has been conducted by Active Network and a definitive purchase agreement was executed on June 25, 2007.   The sale is subject to the approval of the Company  s stockholders and, if ratified, must be completed within two days of the Company  s August 15, 2007 annual meeting.    Financial Detail of the Discontinued Operations    The results of operations of the discontinued InfoSpherix segment, including the costs to sell the segment, are as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Income from discontinued   operations before taxes                                                                                                                                                                            The principal balance sheet items of the assets held for sale are stated below.   Under the terms of the agreement InfoSpherix is permitted to distribute its cash to Spherix, which the Company plans to do prior to the closing.   The agreement also contains a tangible net asset clause that may limit the amount of cash Spherix is entitled to retain.   The cash and cash equivalent balances reflect the cash balances required to satisfy the minimum tangible net assets requirement as calculated on the respective balance sheet dates presented below.

Diluted net income per common share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus common shares outstanding that are assumed likely to be exercised.   Diluted net loss per common share has been computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding without an assumed increase in common shares outstanding for common stock equivalents, as common stock equivalents are antidilutive.   Common stock equivalents consist of stock options and warrants that are assumed likely to be exercised.   Common stock equivalents were 55,470 and 66,886 at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.       During the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Company sold 442,358 shares for an additional $757,500 in proceeds under the July 22, 2005, Standby Equity Distribution Agreement (  SEDA  ).   At June 30, 2007, the remaining maximum amount available for future draws under the SEDA was $800,000.    On March 9, 2006, in exchange for the Company  s agreement to reduce the exercise price to $2.04 per share, an institutional investor (  the Investor  ) agreed to exercise the remainder of its warrants for the purchase of 585,973 shares of common stock for total proceeds of approximately $1.2 million.   In connection with these warrants, the Investor agreed that it would not exercise any of the warrants to the extent that it would acquire shares of Common Stock exceeding 9.9% of the outstanding Common Stock, nor would it knowingly sell shares to anyone to the extent that their holdings in the Company would exceed 4.9% of the outstanding Common Stock.   The warrants and shares of Common Stock were issued in transactions exempt from Registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.   The Company has registered the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants for resale by the institutional Investor.       Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R)   Share-Based Payment   (FAS 123R), which requires the measurement of all employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value based method and the recording of such expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.   The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model and has elected to use the modified prospective transition method and, therefore, has not restated results for prior periods.   At the time the Company adopted FAS 123R, there were no unvested options outstanding. The Company realized stock based compensation expense of $7,000 and $14,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, and $7,000 and $10,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, related to 59,000 stock options awarded in February 2006.   The effect of adopting FAS 123R increased the loss from operations, the loss before taxes, and the net loss by $7,000 and $14,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, and $7,000 and $10,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, and had no effect on basic and diluted earnings per share, net cash flow from operations, or net cash flow from financing activities.    A summary of option activity under the Company  s employee stock option plan for the six months ended June 30, 2007, is presented below:                                                                  Average    Exercise    Price                            Average    Remaining    Contractual    Term                            Intrinsic    Value                               Outstanding at   December 31, 2006                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Outstanding at   June 30, 2007                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Exercisable at   June 30, 2007                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                As of June 30, 2007, there were approximately 25,500 unvested options to purchase common stock under the plans.   An estimated compensation cost of $73,000 related to the unvested options is expected to be recognized over the next 2.6 years.    The Company used the following assumptions in the Black-Scholes calculation used to measure the fair value of stock-based compensation in accordance with FAS 123R.                                                                        Expected   volatility                                                       Expected   dividends                                                                                                                The Company adopted Financial Standards Accounting Board Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (  FIN 48  ) on January 1, 2007.   As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized no material adjustments.   The Company  s policy is to recognize interest and penalties on tax liabilities as interest expense.   At January 1, 2007 and June 30, 2007, the Company had no unrecognized income tax benefits and recognized no interest or penalties on income tax liabilities.    The Federal and significant State statutes of limitations have not expired for the Company  s tax years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2005.   As such, each of these tax years remain subject to examination by taxing authorities.   The Federal and significant State statutes of limitations for the Company  s tax years ended December 31, 1998, December 31, 1999 and December 31, 2002 have expired  however $10,217,000 of Federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in these closed years remain available to the Company and are subject to adjustment prior to utilization in future tax years.       The Company operates via two principal segments, BioSpherix and InfoSpherix.   BioSpherix develops proprietary products for commercial applications.   InfoSpherix provides contact center information and reservation services for government and industry, with substantially all of InfoSpherix revenue generated from government customers.   Revenue from reservation and tourism services is greatest in the spring and summer when vacation planning is the heaviest.   Revenue from other sources tends to be more evenly spread throughout the year, although the fourth quarter is historically the low period of the year.    Financial information by business segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 is summarized below.

The target commencement date for the new lease is November 1, 2007.   In connection with the signing of the above lease, Spherix also signed a lease termination agreement on its Beltsville facility.   Under the lease termination agreement, Spherix will pay a termination fee of $475,000 and the termination date is to be effective with the commencement of the Clarksburg lease.    On June 25, 2007, as part of the Definitive Purchase Agreement to sell InfoSpherix, the Company agreed to terminate the InfoSpherix line-of-credit with Bank of America (  the Bank  ) prior to closing.   Accordingly, the Company has subsequently closed the line-of-credit with the Bank.   The InfoSpherix bank line-of-credit was established on March 31, 2006.   The line-of-credit provided for borrowings up to $1.5 million, was collateralized by the subsidiary  s accounts receivables and equipment, and contained covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to EBITDA ratios.   The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement at June 30, 2007, and at the time of termination.    Item 2.   Management  s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    The following is intended to update the information contained in the Company  s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, and presumes that readers have access to, and will have read,   Management  s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   contained in such Form 10-K.    Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as   believes,     expects,   is or are   expected,     anticipates,     anticipated,     should   and words of similar impact.   These forward-looking statements are based on the Company  s current expectations.   Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the Company  s actual results could differ materially.   See the Company  s Form 8-K filing dated March 26, 1999, for a more detailed statement concerning forward-looking statements.       The Company operates via two principal segments, BioSpherix and InfoSpherix.   BioSpherix develops proprietary products for commercial applications.   InfoSpherix provides contact center information and reservation services for government and industry, with substantially all of InfoSpherix revenue generated from government customers.                BioSpherix engages in product development, notably tagatose.   The Company  s current focus is on the non-food use of tagatose, which we will market under the name   Naturlose  .   Our principal efforts have been to explore whether Naturlose is an effective treatment for Type 2 diabetes.   In April 2007, the Company commenced a Phase 3 trial for this purpose.    InfoSpherix has developed a niche in providing campground and other reservation services via its ReserveWorld business line and is one of only two major suppliers of campground reservation services in the U.S.   Reservation contracts make up over 50% of the Company  s revenue.   The reservation services contracts have revenue streams that are historically greater in the spring and summer months when vacation planning is more prevalent.   These reservation contracts have certain fixed costs that continue throughout the year such as depreciation, telephone and computer related service and maintenance contracts, and minimum staffing requirements.   These contracts also incur certain costs in advance of the peak seasons in order to staff up and train the work force that will be needed during the peak seasons.   On January 23, 2007, the Company concluded its long-standing National Park Service contract.   The National Park Service contract contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.    On June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval.   The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division  s biotechnology products, with the principal focus on the commercialization of Naturlose.   The sale is subject to the approval of the Company  s stockholders and, if ratified, must be completed within two days of the Company  s August 15, 2007 annual meeting.    The operations of InfoSpherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations.    Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2007 and 2006    Selling, General and Administrative    Selling, general and administrative expenses (S,G&amp A) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, increased $386,000 and $494,000 over those of the same periods in 2006.   The increase in the second quarter was primarily the result of an executive bonus of $150,000 awarded to the CEO for past performance, and an increase in accounting costs of approximately $120,000 related to the increased complexity of the Company  s tax reporting requirements including the implementation of FIN 48.   The increase in S,G&amp A costs for the six months ended June 30, 2007 over those of the prior year also included approximately $120,000 in costs related to the services of an investment banker prior to the Company  s decision to sell InfoSpherix.   Excluded from the above S,G&amp A numbers is approximately $170,000 in consulting and legal costs related to the sale of InfoSpherix that have been classified as part of the costs of the discontinued operations.   These costs were incurred in the second quarter of 2007, following the decision to sell InfoSpherix.    Research and Development    The Company  s R&amp D expenditures have significantly increased between years as a direct result of the Company  s Phase 3 clinical trial in the use of Naturlose for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, which began this year.   The primary focus of BioSpherix  s research and development (R&amp D) activities for the six months ended June 30, 2007, has been on the planning and preparation of a Phase 3 trial.   The Company has completed an initial dose range-finding study, and the recruitment of patients for the trial, which will take place in Australia and the United States, is ongoing.   The first participants began the Phase 3 clinical trial in April 2007.   More than 400 subjects from the United States and abroad, representing the demographic mix in the U.S., will receive oral doses of Naturlose to test its ability to treat Type 2 diabetes.   A Phase 3 clinical trial, which gathers evidence regarding effectiveness and safety, is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of new drugs proposed to the FDA.   The Company believes its chances for a successful outcome are enhanced by the widely demonstrated safety of the product, lack of safety being the primary cause for failure of most drug candidates.   Testing is scheduled to finish in mid-2009.   If the trial is successful, it will likely take several months to compile the data and submit a new drug application (  NDA  ) to the FDA.   The FDA will then likely take up to a year to respond to the NDA.   Accordingly, we do not expect FDA approval before mid-2010 at the earliest.                In 2005, the Company contracted with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct a human clinical trial on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of Naturlose.   The study demonstrated tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria, which form plaque, than is sorbitol, a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products.   The study suggested ways of modifying the Naturlose product to effect desired plaque reduction.   Such modifications have been made, and the Company has arranged with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct a trial of Naturlose toothpaste formulated by the Company in an attempt to establish an anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis claim for the toothpaste.   The clinical trial started in early 2007.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Direct cost and   operating expense                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, decreased $1.1 million (14%) and $1.7 million (12%) from the same periods in 2006 due to the completion of the National Park Service contract, which concluded on January 23, 2007.   Reductions from the direct costs associated with the National Park Service Contract were off-set by increased costs under the new Michigan contract and additional costs incurred under the contracts transferred from the former South Dakota facility to the new facility in Indiana.   The National Park Service contract contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.    Liquidity and Capital Resources, Consolidated    On June 25, 2007, as part of the Definitive Purchase Agreement to sell InfoSpherix, the Company agreed to terminate the InfoSpherix line-of-credit with Bank of America (  the Bank  ) prior to closing.   Accordingly, the Company subsequently closed the line-of-credit with the Bank.   The InfoSpherix bank line-of-credit was established on March 31, 2006.   The line-of-credit provided for borrowings up to $1.5 million, was collateralized by the subsidiary  s accounts receivables and equipment, and contained covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to EBITDA ratios.   The interest rate under the Agreement was based on the LIBOR daily floating rate plus 3% (approximately 8.5% at June 30, 2007).   The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement at June 30, 2007, and the total amount available for future advances to the subsidiary was $1.5 million under the Agreement.    Working capital as of June 30, 2007, was $7.8 million, which represents a $3.1 million decrease from working capital of $10.9 million at December 31, 2006.   The decrease in working capital was largely related to the Company  s Phase 3 clinical trial costs and increased costs related to the anticipated sale of InfoSpherix.    Spherix expects to expend up to $5 million over the next year in costs related to the Phase 3 clinical trial and other R&amp D activity.   The clinical trial is expected to take at least two years to complete.   The Company intends to finance the BioSpherix activities through proceeds from the sale of the InfoSpherix subsidiary and proceeds from possible future issuance of additional common stock.   The Company also intends to seek pharmaceutical partners to assist in completing development of the BioSpherix products.    Cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2007, reflects a net cash outflow of $2.8 million, consisting of $2.4 million used in operating activities, $1.2 million used in investing activities, and $768,000 provided by financing activities.   The increase in cash used by operating activities in 2007 from that of the prior year is primarily related to the cost of the Phase 3 clinical trial.   The change in cash used in investing activities is related to one-time proceeds of $2 million from the maturity of a certificate of deposit in the prior year.   Cash flows from financing activities in 2006 included proceeds from the issuance of warrants.                      Trends and Outlooks       On June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval, for $17 million ($15 million at closing and $2 million following a 15-month escrow period).   The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division  s biotechnology products.    BioSpherix  s primary emphasis is on a Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate that Naturlose is a successful treatment for Type 2 diabetes.   The trial began in April 2007, and testing is scheduled to finish in mid-2009.   If the trial is successful, it will likely take several months to compile the data and submit a new drug application (  NDA  ) to the FDA.   The FDA will then likely take up to a year to respond to the NDA.   Accordingly, we do not expect FDA approval before mid-to-late 2010 at the earliest.    The Company has decided to conduct the entire Phase 3 clinical trial for Type 2 diabetes in the United States and according has terminating the Australian trials. The change is intended to simplify the logistics of managing the trial.    Costs of conducting the Phase 3 trial have substantially increased as we have obtained further direction from the FDA concerning the processes to be employed in the trial.   The Company expects to spend up to $5 million in R&amp D costs over the next year.   The Company intends to use the proceeds from the sale of the InfoSpherix subsidiary to fund the Phase 3 trial.   If the sale is not concluded, the Company will need to reassess continuation of the tests in view of the increased costs of the tests and the expected follow-on costs in pursuit of FDA approval.    A human clinical trial on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of Naturlose was conducted by the Company at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry.   The trial started in early 2007 and was completed in July.   The Company expects to receive the results later this year.    Spherix has subsequently launched a health sciences consulting business line to provide technical and regulatory consulting services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.       As noted above, on June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval, for $17 million ($15 million at closing and $2 million following a 15-month escrow period).    The Company concluded the National Park Service contract on January 23, 2007.   The National Park Service contract contributed approximately $4 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.   The loss of the National Park Service contract will have an adverse effect on the Company  s financial results in comparison to the prior year.    Since 1998, InfoSpherix has grown its government park reservation business from one contract to 17 government reservation contracts.   InfoSpherix  s reservation business accounted for over 60% of the Company  s revenue in 2006 and 2005, and over 50% for the three months ended March 31, 2007.   InfoSpherix is now one of only two major suppliers of Government campground reservation services in the U.S.    On February 6, 2007, InfoSpherix signed an agreement to lease 32,423 square feet of facility space in Frostburg, Maryland effective December 1, 2007, for use as a call center to replace the existing Cumberland, Maryland facility.    In August 2007, InfoSpherix signed a ten-year lease to rent 13,338 square feet of facility space in Clarksburg, Maryland, for use as an administrative office for InfoSpherix.   The target commencement date for the new lease is November 1, 2007.   In connection with the signing of the above lease, Spherix also signed a lease termination agreement on its Beltsville facility.   Under the lease termination agreement, Spherix will pay a termination fee of $475,000 and the termination date is to be effective with the commencement of the Clarksburg lease.    The Company will cease to have any continuing obligations under the Frostburg, Maryland, or Clarksburg, Maryland, leases upon completion of the sale of InfoSpherix.   The Company will relocate to a smaller facility upon termination of the Beltsville lease.                Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    The Company manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies.    At June 30, 2007, the Company did not have any fixed-rate or variable-rate indebtedness.   The Company has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness.    Cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds, which generally mature in 30 days, or money-market funds.   In general, such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.   The carrying amounts approximate market value.   It is the Company  s practice to hold these investments to maturity.    Assuming the June 30, 2007, variable rate debt and cash and cash available for investment, a one-percent change in interest rates would impact net interest income by less than $100,000.    Item 4.   Controls and Procedures    Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports, such as this report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC  s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. These controls and procedures are based closely on the definition of   disclosure controls and procedures   in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act.  Rules adopted by the SEC require that we present the conclusions of the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.    Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.   Management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.   These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.   Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management  s override of the control.   The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.   Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.    Periodic Evaluation and Conclusion.     The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company  s management, including the Company  s Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company  s disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objective pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company  s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level.   There were no significant changes in internal controls during the latest quarter over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting.                Part II.   Other Information    Item 1a.   Risk Factors    In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,   Item 1A Risk Factors   in our Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2006, and those included in the Company  s Proxy Statement for the August 15, 2007 annual meeting, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Accordingly, the operations of InfoSpherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and the assets held for sale of the discontinued segment are separately identified in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The activities of the BioSpherix Division continue to operate through Spherix Incorporated. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are unaudited and do not include all of the information and disclosures generally required for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, the statements contain all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position as of June 30, 2007, the results of its operations for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, and its cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006. This report should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which does contain the complete information and disclosure for the year ended December 31, 2006. Use of Estimates and Assumptions The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Discontinued Operations On June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval. The InfoSpherix segment comprises the majority of the Company s operations. The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division s biotechnology products, with the principal focus on the commercialization of Naturlose. The sale is subject to the approval of the Company s stockholders and, if ratified, must be completed within two days of the Company s August 15, 2007 annual meeting. Spherix employed a business model for many years where it operated two separate lines of business InfoSpherix and BioSpherix. In accordance with the business plan, InfoSpherix earned enough money to support itself and BioSpherix. This allowed InfoSpherix to grow while supplying funds for the research and development efforts of the BioSpherix Division, which focused on developing healthcare-related products. By mid-2004, management believed that this model would soon have to change. The product mix in InfoSpherix was shifting away from the commercial sector to a less profitable government sector. Clients were beginning to require that the Company fund the upfront costs for information projects and recover the cost over the life of the project. Also, our BioSpherix products were far enough along where continued development would soon require significant capital. In addition, equity investors interested in BioSpherix did not understand InfoSpherix and its purpose. Therefore, responsible investors were more difficult to attract. Our InfoSpherix clients became concerned about our focus on this business and they questioned our long-term commitment to the business. Also, our bank stated that it was not interested in funding biotechnology research. Therefore, they required the Company to secure its line of credit with cash in lieu of receivables and other fixed assets. Financing for capital equipment was becoming harder to attract. As a result, at the February 17, 2005 meeting, the Board of Directors decided it was time to split the two divisions and require each one to be self-funding. On June 8, 2005, the stockholders approved the establishment of InfoSpherix Incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spherix. Subsequently, on January 1, 2006, InfoSpherix began operating as an independent subsidiary. In December 2005, the FDA gave Spherix final permission to conduct a Phase 3 clinical trial for Naturlose as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes. The Company signed agreements with independent contract research organizations to conduct the Phase 3 trial and engaged another entity to assist in the development and monitoring of the trials and to consult on FDA issues. Although initial estimates developed by Spherix and the above consultants indicated we had sufficient capital to complete the trial, the Board and management became concerned about long-term financing. A manufacturing source needed to be found and, should complications develop in our Phase 3 trial, final FDA approval of the protocol could result in significant additional capital needs. In addition, it was becoming clear that InfoSpherix also needed capital to develop next generation products. In the spring of 2006, Active Network approached the Company expressing an interest in the reservation portion of the InfoSpherix business and the Company held some preliminary discussion with the Active Network during the next few months. On June 27, 2006, a meeting of the Executive Advisory Committee of the Board was held in Cumberland, Maryland. The Committee discussed a potential sale of all or part of the InfoSpherix subsidiary, along with the use of funds from this sale and any settlement of our National Park Service dispute. The Committee agreed that it was premature to make a decision as to whether any sale of InfoSpherix was desirable. However, the Committee decided that if a sale was ever to be pursued, a sale of the entire subsidiary was preferential and that other potential buyers should be sought. On November 17, 2006, the Company received a letter through its FDA consultant requiring additional expenditures on its Phase 3 clinical trial. At this point it was becoming apparent that the Phase 3 trial was going to be more expensive than first thought. Also on November 17, 2006, the Company received an unsolicited Letter of Intent (LOI) from Active Network. The LOI was for the purchase of the entire information business. The Board met on November 21, 2006. After review of the LOI from The Active Network, the Board declined the offer. Discussions were held on the need to raise more capital, even with the $6 million settlement related to the National Park Service. The rising cost of the Phase 3 trial was discussed along with the need to complete the anti-plaque study of Naturlose at the University of Maryland. Several methods of raising capital were discussed, but no final decision was made. A special Board Meeting was held on January 8, 2007. The immediate need to raise capital was discussed and the President was authorized to seek equity funding for $12-15 million to fund the BioSpherix Division. In addition, further discussions were held to consider the possibility of selling InfoSpherix as a means of raising cash. SC&amp H Capital Corporation ( SC&amp H ), a consulting firm with merger and acquisition experience, was engaged on January 29, 2007, to assist the management team in exploring a sale of InfoSpherix. On March 6, 2007, the Board of Directors created an Evaluation Committee consisting of three outside directors appointed to provide SC&amp H with guidance in the process and to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest. During the first several months of 2007, the President met with several investment bankers about the possibility of raising capital. It was decided that, given the current stock price and early phase of the Phase 3 clinical trial, an equity offering would not be prudent at this time. On April 13, 2007, a Board Meeting was held to review the capital raising alternatives. In the course of reviewing these alternatives, SC&amp H reviewed the process it had conducted with management to that point. Contact had been made with approximately 100 companies, including both strategic and financial targets, through the use of a blind profile which outlined the InfoSpherix opportunity. This campaign ultimately resulted in approximately 10 management presentations provided to various interested parties. The above activities yielded four Letters of Intent, including a revised offer from The Active Network. One of the Letters of Intent was ultimately withdrawn. SC&amp H prepared a comparison of each of the Letters of Intent and presented it to the Evaluation Committee. A discussion of the possible terms and requirements of a deal ensued. Pursuant to a recommendation from the Evaluation Committee, the Board concluded that a sale of InfoSpherix was in the best interests of Spherix and the Board approved a resolution to accept the offer from Active Network as proposed. The Evaluation Committee was given the authority to approve any changes to the LOI consistent with the discussions. Subsequent negotiations, led by the management team and outside counsel, were held with The Active Network and on April 17, 2007, a final LOI was signed. Detailed due diligence has been conducted by Active Network and a definitive purchase agreement was executed on June 25, 2007. The sale is subject to the approval of the Company s stockholders and, if ratified, must be completed within two days of the Company s August 15, 2007 annual meeting. Financial Detail of the Discontinued Operations The results of operations of the discontinued InfoSpherix segment, including the costs to sell the segment, are as follows: Income from discontinued operations before taxes The principal balance sheet items of the assets held for sale are stated below. Under the terms of the agreement InfoSpherix is permitted to distribute its cash to Spherix, which the Company plans to do prior to the closing. The agreement also contains a tangible net asset clause that may limit the amount of cash Spherix is entitled to retain. The cash and cash equivalent balances reflect the cash balances required to satisfy the minimum tangible net assets requirement as calculated on the respective balance sheet dates presented below. (Unaudited) 2006 Current assets Non-Current assets Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization of $465,000 and $395,000 Current liabilities Non-Current liabilities Basic net income (loss) per common share has been computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus common shares outstanding that are assumed likely to be exercised. Diluted net loss per common share has been computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding without an assumed increase in common shares outstanding for common stock equivalents, as common stock equivalents are antidilutive. Common stock equivalents consist of stock options and warrants that are assumed likely to be exercised. Common stock equivalents were 55,470 and 66,886 at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Company sold 442,358 shares for an additional $757,500 in proceeds under the July 22, 2005, Standby Equity Distribution Agreement ( SEDA ). At June 30, 2007, the remaining maximum amount available for future draws under the SEDA was $800,000. On March 9, 2006, in exchange for the Company s agreement to reduce the exercise price to $2.04 per share, an institutional investor ( the Investor ) agreed to exercise the remainder of its warrants for the purchase of 585,973 shares of common stock for total proceeds of approximately $1.2 million. In connection with these warrants, the Investor agreed that it would not exercise any of the warrants to the extent that it would acquire shares of Common Stock exceeding 9.9% of the outstanding Common Stock, nor would it knowingly sell shares to anyone to the extent that their holdings in the Company would exceed 4.9% of the outstanding Common Stock. The warrants and shares of Common Stock were issued in transactions exempt from Registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Company has registered the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants for resale by the institutional Investor. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) Share-Based Payment (FAS 123R), which requires the measurement of all employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value based method and the recording of such expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model and has elected to use the modified prospective transition method and, therefore, has not restated results for prior periods. At the time the Company adopted FAS 123R, there were no unvested options outstanding. The Company realized stock based compensation expense of $7,000 and $14,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, and $7,000 and $10,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, related to 59,000 stock options awarded in February 2006. The effect of adopting FAS 123R increased the loss from operations, the loss before taxes, and the net loss by $7,000 and $14,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, and $7,000 and $10,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, and had no effect on basic and diluted earnings per share, net cash flow from operations, or net cash flow from financing activities. A summary of option activity under the Company s employee stock option plan for the six months ended June 30, 2007, is presented below: Average Exercise Price Average Remaining Contractual Term Intrinsic Value Outstanding at December 31, 2006 Outstanding at June 30, 2007 Exercisable at June 30, 2007 As of June 30, 2007, there were approximately 25,500 unvested options to purchase common stock under the plans. An estimated compensation cost of $73,000 related to the unvested options is expected to be recognized over the next 2.6 years. The Company used the following assumptions in the Black-Scholes calculation used to measure the fair value of stock-based compensation in accordance with FAS 123R. Expected volatility Expected dividends The Company adopted Financial Standards Accounting Board Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ( FIN 48 ) on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized no material adjustments. The Company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties on tax liabilities as interest expense. At January 1, 2007 and June 30, 2007, the Company had no unrecognized income tax benefits and recognized no interest or penalties on income tax liabilities. The Federal and significant State statutes of limitations have not expired for the Company s tax years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2005. As such, each of these tax years remain subject to examination by taxing authorities. The Federal and significant State statutes of limitations for the Company s tax years ended December 31, 1998, December 31, 1999 and December 31, 2002 have expired however $10,217,000 of Federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in these closed years remain available to the Company and are subject to adjustment prior to utilization in future tax years. The Company operates via two principal segments, BioSpherix and InfoSpherix. BioSpherix develops proprietary products for commercial applications. InfoSpherix provides contact center information and reservation services for government and industry, with substantially all of InfoSpherix revenue generated from government customers. Revenue from reservation and tourism services is greatest in the spring and summer when vacation planning is the heaviest. Revenue from other sources tends to be more evenly spread throughout the year, although the fourth quarter is historically the low period of the year. Financial information by business segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 is summarized below. June 30, (Dollars in thousands) June 30, (Dollars in thousands) Total revenue Operating (Loss) Income Total operating loss Income (loss) from operations before income taxes Identifiable Assets Total assets In August 2007, InfoSpherix signed a ten-year lease to rent 13,338 square feet of facility space in Clarksburg, Maryland, for use as an administrative office for InfoSpherix. The target commencement date for the new lease is November 1, 2007. In connection with the signing of the above lease, Spherix also signed a lease termination agreement on its Beltsville facility. Under the lease termination agreement, Spherix will pay a termination fee of $475,000 and the termination date is to be effective with the commencement of the Clarksburg lease. On June 25, 2007, as part of the Definitive Purchase Agreement to sell InfoSpherix, the Company agreed to terminate the InfoSpherix line-of-credit with Bank of America ( the Bank ) prior to closing. Accordingly, the Company has subsequently closed the line-of-credit with the Bank. The InfoSpherix bank line-of-credit was established on March 31, 2006. The line-of-credit provided for borrowings up to $1.5 million, was collateralized by the subsidiary s accounts receivables and equipment, and contained covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to EBITDA ratios. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement at June 30, 2007, and at the time of termination. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is intended to update the information contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, and presumes that readers have access to, and will have read, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in such Form 10-K. Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as believes, expects, is or are expected, anticipates, anticipated, should and words of similar impact. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company s current expectations. Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the Company s actual results could differ materially. See the Company s Form 8-K filing dated March 26, 1999, for a more detailed statement concerning forward-looking statements. The Company operates via two principal segments, BioSpherix and InfoSpherix. BioSpherix develops proprietary products for commercial applications. InfoSpherix provides contact center information and reservation services for government and industry, with substantially all of InfoSpherix revenue generated from government customers. BioSpherix engages in product development, notably tagatose. The Company s current focus is on the non-food use of tagatose, which we will market under the name Naturlose . Our principal efforts have been to explore whether Naturlose is an effective treatment for Type 2 diabetes. In April 2007, the Company commenced a Phase 3 trial for this purpose. InfoSpherix has developed a niche in providing campground and other reservation services via its ReserveWorld business line and is one of only two major suppliers of campground reservation services in the U.S. Reservation contracts make up over 50% of the Company s revenue. The reservation services contracts have revenue streams that are historically greater in the spring and summer months when vacation planning is more prevalent. These reservation contracts have certain fixed costs that continue throughout the year such as depreciation, telephone and computer related service and maintenance contracts, and minimum staffing requirements. These contracts also incur certain costs in advance of the peak seasons in order to staff up and train the work force that will be needed during the peak seasons. On January 23, 2007, the Company concluded its long-standing National Park Service contract. The National Park Service contract contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. On June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval. The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division s biotechnology products, with the principal focus on the commercialization of Naturlose. The sale is subject to the approval of the Company s stockholders and, if ratified, must be completed within two days of the Company s August 15, 2007 annual meeting. The operations of InfoSpherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations. Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses (S,G&amp A) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, increased $386,000 and $494,000 over those of the same periods in 2006. The increase in the second quarter was primarily the result of an executive bonus of $150,000 awarded to the CEO for past performance, and an increase in accounting costs of approximately $120,000 related to the increased complexity of the Company s tax reporting requirements including the implementation of FIN 48. The increase in S,G&amp A costs for the six months ended June 30, 2007 over those of the prior year also included approximately $120,000 in costs related to the services of an investment banker prior to the Company s decision to sell InfoSpherix. Excluded from the above S,G&amp A numbers is approximately $170,000 in consulting and legal costs related to the sale of InfoSpherix that have been classified as part of the costs of the discontinued operations. These costs were incurred in the second quarter of 2007, following the decision to sell InfoSpherix. Research and Development The Company s R&amp D expenditures have significantly increased between years as a direct result of the Company s Phase 3 clinical trial in the use of Naturlose for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, which began this year. The primary focus of BioSpherix s research and development (R&amp D) activities for the six months ended June 30, 2007, has been on the planning and preparation of a Phase 3 trial. The Company has completed an initial dose range-finding study, and the recruitment of patients for the trial, which will take place in Australia and the United States, is ongoing. The first participants began the Phase 3 clinical trial in April 2007. More than 400 subjects from the United States and abroad, representing the demographic mix in the U.S., will receive oral doses of Naturlose to test its ability to treat Type 2 diabetes. A Phase 3 clinical trial, which gathers evidence regarding effectiveness and safety, is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of new drugs proposed to the FDA. The Company believes its chances for a successful outcome are enhanced by the widely demonstrated safety of the product, lack of safety being the primary cause for failure of most drug candidates. Testing is scheduled to finish in mid-2009. If the trial is successful, it will likely take several months to compile the data and submit a new drug application ( NDA ) to the FDA. The FDA will then likely take up to a year to respond to the NDA. Accordingly, we do not expect FDA approval before mid-2010 at the earliest. In 2005, the Company contracted with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct a human clinical trial on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of Naturlose. The study demonstrated tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria, which form plaque, than is sorbitol, a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products. The study suggested ways of modifying the Naturlose product to effect desired plaque reduction. Such modifications have been made, and the Company has arranged with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct a trial of Naturlose toothpaste formulated by the Company in an attempt to establish an anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis claim for the toothpaste. The clinical trial started in early 2007. Direct cost and operating expense Revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, decreased $1.1 million (14%) and $1.7 million (12%) from the same periods in 2006 due to the completion of the National Park Service contract, which concluded on January 23, 2007. Reductions from the direct costs associated with the National Park Service Contract were off-set by increased costs under the new Michigan contract and additional costs incurred under the contracts transferred from the former South Dakota facility to the new facility in Indiana. The National Park Service contract contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources, Consolidated On June 25, 2007, as part of the Definitive Purchase Agreement to sell InfoSpherix, the Company agreed to terminate the InfoSpherix line-of-credit with Bank of America ( the Bank ) prior to closing. Accordingly, the Company subsequently closed the line-of-credit with the Bank. The InfoSpherix bank line-of-credit was established on March 31, 2006. The line-of-credit provided for borrowings up to $1.5 million, was collateralized by the subsidiary s accounts receivables and equipment, and contained covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to EBITDA ratios. The interest rate under the Agreement was based on the LIBOR daily floating rate plus 3% (approximately 8.5% at June 30, 2007). The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement at June 30, 2007, and the total amount available for future advances to the subsidiary was $1.5 million under the Agreement. Working capital as of June 30, 2007, was $7.8 million, which represents a $3.1 million decrease from working capital of $10.9 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in working capital was largely related to the Company s Phase 3 clinical trial costs and increased costs related to the anticipated sale of InfoSpherix. Spherix expects to expend up to $5 million over the next year in costs related to the Phase 3 clinical trial and other R&amp D activity. The clinical trial is expected to take at least two years to complete. The Company intends to finance the BioSpherix activities through proceeds from the sale of the InfoSpherix subsidiary and proceeds from possible future issuance of additional common stock. The Company also intends to seek pharmaceutical partners to assist in completing development of the BioSpherix products. Cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2007, reflects a net cash outflow of $2.8 million, consisting of $2.4 million used in operating activities, $1.2 million used in investing activities, and $768,000 provided by financing activities. The increase in cash used by operating activities in 2007 from that of the prior year is primarily related to the cost of the Phase 3 clinical trial. The change in cash used in investing activities is related to one-time proceeds of $2 million from the maturity of a certificate of deposit in the prior year. Cash flows from financing activities in 2006 included proceeds from the issuance of warrants. Trends and Outlooks On June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval, for $17 million ($15 million at closing and $2 million following a 15-month escrow period). The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division s biotechnology products. BioSpherix s primary emphasis is on a Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate that Naturlose is a successful treatment for Type 2 diabetes. The trial began in April 2007, and testing is scheduled to finish in mid-2009. If the trial is successful, it will likely take several months to compile the data and submit a new drug application ( NDA ) to the FDA. The FDA will then likely take up to a year to respond to the NDA. Accordingly, we do not expect FDA approval before mid-to-late 2010 at the earliest. The Company has decided to conduct the entire Phase 3 clinical trial for Type 2 diabetes in the United States and according has terminating the Australian trials. The change is intended to simplify the logistics of managing the trial. Costs of conducting the Phase 3 trial have substantially increased as we have obtained further direction from the FDA concerning the processes to be employed in the trial. The Company expects to spend up to $5 million in R&amp D costs over the next year. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the sale of the InfoSpherix subsidiary to fund the Phase 3 trial. If the sale is not concluded, the Company will need to reassess continuation of the tests in view of the increased costs of the tests and the expected follow-on costs in pursuit of FDA approval. A human clinical trial on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of Naturlose was conducted by the Company at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry. The trial started in early 2007 and was completed in July. The Company expects to receive the results later this year. Spherix has subsequently launched a health sciences consulting business line to provide technical and regulatory consulting services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. As noted above, on June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval, for $17 million ($15 million at closing and $2 million following a 15-month escrow period). The Company concluded the National Park Service contract on January 23, 2007. The National Park Service contract contributed approximately $4 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. The loss of the National Park Service contract will have an adverse effect on the Company s financial results in comparison to the prior year. Since 1998, InfoSpherix has grown its government park reservation business from one contract to 17 government reservation contracts. InfoSpherix s reservation business accounted for over 60% of the Company s revenue in 2006 and 2005, and over 50% for the three months ended March 31, 2007. InfoSpherix is now one of only two major suppliers of Government campground reservation services in the U.S. On February 6, 2007, InfoSpherix signed an agreement to lease 32,423 square feet of facility space in Frostburg, Maryland effective December 1, 2007, for use as a call center to replace the existing Cumberland, Maryland facility. In August 2007, InfoSpherix signed a ten-year lease to rent 13,338 square feet of facility space in Clarksburg, Maryland, for use as an administrative office for InfoSpherix. The target commencement date for the new lease is November 1, 2007. In connection with the signing of the above lease, Spherix also signed a lease termination agreement on its Beltsville facility. Under the lease termination agreement, Spherix will pay a termination fee of $475,000 and the termination date is to be effective with the commencement of the Clarksburg lease. The Company will cease to have any continuing obligations under the Frostburg, Maryland, or Clarksburg, Maryland, leases upon completion of the sale of InfoSpherix. The Company will relocate to a smaller facility upon termination of the Beltsville lease. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. At June 30, 2007, the Company did not have any fixed-rate or variable-rate indebtedness. The Company has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness. Cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds, which generally mature in 30 days, or money-market funds. In general, such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. The carrying amounts approximate market value. It is the Company s practice to hold these investments to maturity. Assuming the June 30, 2007, variable rate debt and cash and cash available for investment, a one-percent change in interest rates would impact net interest income by less than $100,000. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports, such as this report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. These controls and procedures are based closely on the definition of disclosure controls and procedures in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Rules adopted by the SEC require that we present the conclusions of the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls. Management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management s override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Periodic Evaluation and Conclusion. The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objective pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level. There were no significant changes in internal controls during the latest quarter over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting. Part II. Other Information Item 1a.

Accordingly, the operations of InfoSpherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and the assets held for sale of the discontinued segment are separately identified in the Company  s Consolidated Balance Sheet.   The activities of the   BioSpherix   Division continue to operate through Spherix Incorporated.    The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are unaudited and do not include all of the information and disclosures generally required for annual financial statements.   In the opinion of management, the statements contain all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the Company  s financial position as of June 30, 2007, the results of its operations for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, and its cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006.   This report should be read in conjunction with the Company  s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which does contain the complete information and disclosure for the year ended December 31, 2006.    Use of Estimates and Assumptions    The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.   This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period.   Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.    Discontinued Operations    On June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval.   The InfoSpherix segment comprises the majority of the Company  s operations.   The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division  s biotechnology products, with the principal focus on the commercialization of Naturlose.   The sale is subject to the approval of the Company  s stockholders and, if ratified, must be completed within two days of the Company  s August 15, 2007 annual meeting.       Spherix employed a business model for many years where it operated two separate lines of business    InfoSpherix and BioSpherix.   In accordance with the business plan, InfoSpherix earned enough money to support itself and BioSpherix.   This allowed InfoSpherix to grow while supplying funds for the research and development efforts of the BioSpherix Division, which focused on developing healthcare-related products.    By mid-2004, management believed that this model would soon have to change.   The product mix in InfoSpherix was shifting away from the commercial sector to a less profitable government sector.   Clients were beginning to require that the Company fund the upfront costs for information projects and recover the cost over the life of the project.   Also, our BioSpherix products were far enough along where continued development would soon require significant capital.   In addition, equity investors interested in BioSpherix did not understand InfoSpherix and its purpose.   Therefore, responsible investors were more difficult to attract.   Our InfoSpherix clients became concerned about our focus on this business and they questioned our long-term commitment to the business.   Also, our bank stated that it was not interested in funding biotechnology research.   Therefore, they required the Company to secure its line of credit with cash in lieu of receivables and other fixed assets.   Financing for capital equipment was becoming harder to attract.   As a result, at the February 17, 2005 meeting, the Board of Directors decided it was time to split the two divisions and require each one to be self-funding.   On June 8, 2005, the stockholders approved the establishment of InfoSpherix Incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spherix.   Subsequently, on January 1, 2006, InfoSpherix began operating as an independent subsidiary.                In December 2005, the FDA gave Spherix final permission to conduct a Phase 3 clinical trial for Naturlose as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes.   The Company signed agreements with independent contract research organizations to conduct the Phase 3 trial and engaged another entity to assist in the development and monitoring of the trials and to consult on FDA issues.   Although initial estimates developed by Spherix and the above consultants indicated we had sufficient capital to complete the trial, the Board and management became concerned about long-term financing.   A manufacturing source needed to be found and, should complications develop in our Phase 3 trial, final FDA approval of the protocol could result in significant additional capital needs.   In addition, it was becoming clear that InfoSpherix also needed capital to develop next generation products.    In the spring of 2006, Active Network approached the Company expressing an interest in the reservation portion of the InfoSpherix business and the Company held some preliminary discussion with the Active Network during the next few months.   On June 27, 2006, a meeting of the Executive Advisory Committee of the Board was held in Cumberland, Maryland.   The Committee discussed a potential sale of all or part of the InfoSpherix subsidiary, along with the use of funds from this sale and any settlement of our National Park Service dispute.   The Committee agreed that it was premature to make a decision as to whether any sale of InfoSpherix was desirable.   However, the Committee decided that if a sale was ever to be pursued, a sale of the entire subsidiary was preferential and that other potential buyers should be sought.    On November 17, 2006, the Company received a letter through its FDA consultant requiring additional expenditures on its Phase 3 clinical trial.   At this point it was becoming apparent that the Phase 3 trial was going to be more expensive than first thought.    Also on November 17, 2006, the Company received an unsolicited Letter of Intent (LOI) from Active Network.   The LOI was for the purchase of the entire information business.   The Board met on November 21, 2006.   After review of the LOI from The Active Network, the Board declined the offer.   Discussions were held on the need to raise more capital, even with the $6 million settlement related to the National Park Service.   The rising cost of the Phase 3 trial was discussed along with the need to complete the anti-plaque study of Naturlose at the University of Maryland.   Several methods of raising capital were discussed, but no final decision was made.    A special Board Meeting was held on January 8, 2007.   The immediate need to raise capital was discussed and the President was authorized to seek equity funding for $12-15 million to fund the BioSpherix Division.   In addition, further discussions were held to consider the possibility of selling InfoSpherix as a means of raising cash.    SC&amp H Capital Corporation (  SC&amp H  ), a consulting firm with merger and acquisition experience, was engaged on January 29, 2007, to assist the management team in exploring a sale of InfoSpherix.   On March 6, 2007, the Board of Directors created an Evaluation Committee consisting of three outside directors appointed to provide SC&amp H with guidance in the process and to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest.    During the first several months of 2007, the President met with several investment bankers about the possibility of raising capital.   It was decided that, given the current stock price and early phase of the Phase 3 clinical trial, an equity offering would not be prudent at this time.    On April 13, 2007, a Board Meeting was held to review the capital raising alternatives.   In the course of reviewing these alternatives, SC&amp H reviewed the process it had conducted with management to that point.   Contact had been made with approximately 100 companies, including both strategic and financial targets, through the use of a blind profile which outlined the InfoSpherix opportunity.   This campaign ultimately resulted in approximately 10 management presentations provided to various interested parties.   The above activities yielded four Letters of Intent, including a revised offer from The Active Network.   One of the Letters of Intent was ultimately withdrawn.   SC&amp H prepared a comparison of each of the Letters of Intent and presented it to the Evaluation Committee.   A discussion of the possible terms and requirements of a deal ensued.    Pursuant to a recommendation from the Evaluation Committee, the Board concluded that a sale of InfoSpherix was in the best interests of Spherix and the Board approved a resolution to accept the offer from Active Network as proposed.   The Evaluation Committee was given the authority to approve any changes to the LOI consistent with the discussions.                Subsequent negotiations, led by the management team and outside counsel, were held with The Active Network and on April 17, 2007, a final LOI was signed.   Detailed due diligence has been conducted by Active Network and a definitive purchase agreement was executed on June 25, 2007.   The sale is subject to the approval of the Company  s stockholders and, if ratified, must be completed within two days of the Company  s August 15, 2007 annual meeting.    Financial Detail of the Discontinued Operations    The results of operations of the discontinued InfoSpherix segment, including the costs to sell the segment, are as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Income from discontinued   operations before taxes                                                                                                                                                                            The principal balance sheet items of the assets held for sale are stated below.   Under the terms of the agreement InfoSpherix is permitted to distribute its cash to Spherix, which the Company plans to do prior to the closing.   The agreement also contains a tangible net asset clause that may limit the amount of cash Spherix is entitled to retain.   The cash and cash equivalent balances reflect the cash balances required to satisfy the minimum tangible net assets requirement as calculated on the respective balance sheet dates presented below.

Diluted net income per common share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus common shares outstanding that are assumed likely to be exercised.   Diluted net loss per common share has been computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding without an assumed increase in common shares outstanding for common stock equivalents, as common stock equivalents are antidilutive.   Common stock equivalents consist of stock options and warrants that are assumed likely to be exercised.   Common stock equivalents were 55,470 and 66,886 at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.       During the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Company sold 442,358 shares for an additional $757,500 in proceeds under the July 22, 2005, Standby Equity Distribution Agreement (  SEDA  ).   At June 30, 2007, the remaining maximum amount available for future draws under the SEDA was $800,000.    On March 9, 2006, in exchange for the Company  s agreement to reduce the exercise price to $2.04 per share, an institutional investor (  the Investor  ) agreed to exercise the remainder of its warrants for the purchase of 585,973 shares of common stock for total proceeds of approximately $1.2 million.   In connection with these warrants, the Investor agreed that it would not exercise any of the warrants to the extent that it would acquire shares of Common Stock exceeding 9.9% of the outstanding Common Stock, nor would it knowingly sell shares to anyone to the extent that their holdings in the Company would exceed 4.9% of the outstanding Common Stock.   The warrants and shares of Common Stock were issued in transactions exempt from Registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.   The Company has registered the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants for resale by the institutional Investor.       Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R)   Share-Based Payment   (FAS 123R), which requires the measurement of all employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value based method and the recording of such expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.   The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model and has elected to use the modified prospective transition method and, therefore, has not restated results for prior periods.   At the time the Company adopted FAS 123R, there were no unvested options outstanding. The Company realized stock based compensation expense of $7,000 and $14,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, and $7,000 and $10,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, related to 59,000 stock options awarded in February 2006.   The effect of adopting FAS 123R increased the loss from operations, the loss before taxes, and the net loss by $7,000 and $14,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, and $7,000 and $10,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, and had no effect on basic and diluted earnings per share, net cash flow from operations, or net cash flow from financing activities.    A summary of option activity under the Company  s employee stock option plan for the six months ended June 30, 2007, is presented below:                                                                  Average    Exercise    Price                            Average    Remaining    Contractual    Term                            Intrinsic    Value                               Outstanding at   December 31, 2006                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Outstanding at   June 30, 2007                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Exercisable at   June 30, 2007                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                As of June 30, 2007, there were approximately 25,500 unvested options to purchase common stock under the plans.   An estimated compensation cost of $73,000 related to the unvested options is expected to be recognized over the next 2.6 years.    The Company used the following assumptions in the Black-Scholes calculation used to measure the fair value of stock-based compensation in accordance with FAS 123R.                                                                        Expected   volatility                                                       Expected   dividends                                                                                                                The Company adopted Financial Standards Accounting Board Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (  FIN 48  ) on January 1, 2007.   As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized no material adjustments.   The Company  s policy is to recognize interest and penalties on tax liabilities as interest expense.   At January 1, 2007 and June 30, 2007, the Company had no unrecognized income tax benefits and recognized no interest or penalties on income tax liabilities.    The Federal and significant State statutes of limitations have not expired for the Company  s tax years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2005.   As such, each of these tax years remain subject to examination by taxing authorities.   The Federal and significant State statutes of limitations for the Company  s tax years ended December 31, 1998, December 31, 1999 and December 31, 2002 have expired  however $10,217,000 of Federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in these closed years remain available to the Company and are subject to adjustment prior to utilization in future tax years.       The Company operates via two principal segments, BioSpherix and InfoSpherix.   BioSpherix develops proprietary products for commercial applications.   InfoSpherix provides contact center information and reservation services for government and industry, with substantially all of InfoSpherix revenue generated from government customers.   Revenue from reservation and tourism services is greatest in the spring and summer when vacation planning is the heaviest.   Revenue from other sources tends to be more evenly spread throughout the year, although the fourth quarter is historically the low period of the year.    Financial information by business segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 is summarized below.

The target commencement date for the new lease is November 1, 2007.   In connection with the signing of the above lease, Spherix also signed a lease termination agreement on its Beltsville facility.   Under the lease termination agreement, Spherix will pay a termination fee of $475,000 and the termination date is to be effective with the commencement of the Clarksburg lease.    On June 25, 2007, as part of the Definitive Purchase Agreement to sell InfoSpherix, the Company agreed to terminate the InfoSpherix line-of-credit with Bank of America (  the Bank  ) prior to closing.   Accordingly, the Company has subsequently closed the line-of-credit with the Bank.   The InfoSpherix bank line-of-credit was established on March 31, 2006.   The line-of-credit provided for borrowings up to $1.5 million, was collateralized by the subsidiary  s accounts receivables and equipment, and contained covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to EBITDA ratios.   The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement at June 30, 2007, and at the time of termination.    Item 2.   Management  s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    The following is intended to update the information contained in the Company  s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, and presumes that readers have access to, and will have read,   Management  s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   contained in such Form 10-K.    Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as   believes,     expects,   is or are   expected,     anticipates,     anticipated,     should   and words of similar impact.   These forward-looking statements are based on the Company  s current expectations.   Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the Company  s actual results could differ materially.   See the Company  s Form 8-K filing dated March 26, 1999, for a more detailed statement concerning forward-looking statements.       The Company operates via two principal segments, BioSpherix and InfoSpherix.   BioSpherix develops proprietary products for commercial applications.   InfoSpherix provides contact center information and reservation services for government and industry, with substantially all of InfoSpherix revenue generated from government customers.                BioSpherix engages in product development, notably tagatose.   The Company  s current focus is on the non-food use of tagatose, which we will market under the name   Naturlose  .   Our principal efforts have been to explore whether Naturlose is an effective treatment for Type 2 diabetes.   In April 2007, the Company commenced a Phase 3 trial for this purpose.    InfoSpherix has developed a niche in providing campground and other reservation services via its ReserveWorld business line and is one of only two major suppliers of campground reservation services in the U.S.   Reservation contracts make up over 50% of the Company  s revenue.   The reservation services contracts have revenue streams that are historically greater in the spring and summer months when vacation planning is more prevalent.   These reservation contracts have certain fixed costs that continue throughout the year such as depreciation, telephone and computer related service and maintenance contracts, and minimum staffing requirements.   These contracts also incur certain costs in advance of the peak seasons in order to staff up and train the work force that will be needed during the peak seasons.   On January 23, 2007, the Company concluded its long-standing National Park Service contract.   The National Park Service contract contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.    On June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval.   The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division  s biotechnology products, with the principal focus on the commercialization of Naturlose.   The sale is subject to the approval of the Company  s stockholders and, if ratified, must be completed within two days of the Company  s August 15, 2007 annual meeting.    The operations of InfoSpherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations.    Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2007 and 2006    Selling, General and Administrative    Selling, general and administrative expenses (S,G&amp A) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, increased $386,000 and $494,000 over those of the same periods in 2006.   The increase in the second quarter was primarily the result of an executive bonus of $150,000 awarded to the CEO for past performance, and an increase in accounting costs of approximately $120,000 related to the increased complexity of the Company  s tax reporting requirements including the implementation of FIN 48.   The increase in S,G&amp A costs for the six months ended June 30, 2007 over those of the prior year also included approximately $120,000 in costs related to the services of an investment banker prior to the Company  s decision to sell InfoSpherix.   Excluded from the above S,G&amp A numbers is approximately $170,000 in consulting and legal costs related to the sale of InfoSpherix that have been classified as part of the costs of the discontinued operations.   These costs were incurred in the second quarter of 2007, following the decision to sell InfoSpherix.    Research and Development    The Company  s R&amp D expenditures have significantly increased between years as a direct result of the Company  s Phase 3 clinical trial in the use of Naturlose for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, which began this year.   The primary focus of BioSpherix  s research and development (R&amp D) activities for the six months ended June 30, 2007, has been on the planning and preparation of a Phase 3 trial.   The Company has completed an initial dose range-finding study, and the recruitment of patients for the trial, which will take place in Australia and the United States, is ongoing.   The first participants began the Phase 3 clinical trial in April 2007.   More than 400 subjects from the United States and abroad, representing the demographic mix in the U.S., will receive oral doses of Naturlose to test its ability to treat Type 2 diabetes.   A Phase 3 clinical trial, which gathers evidence regarding effectiveness and safety, is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of new drugs proposed to the FDA.   The Company believes its chances for a successful outcome are enhanced by the widely demonstrated safety of the product, lack of safety being the primary cause for failure of most drug candidates.   Testing is scheduled to finish in mid-2009.   If the trial is successful, it will likely take several months to compile the data and submit a new drug application (  NDA  ) to the FDA.   The FDA will then likely take up to a year to respond to the NDA.   Accordingly, we do not expect FDA approval before mid-2010 at the earliest.                In 2005, the Company contracted with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct a human clinical trial on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of Naturlose.   The study demonstrated tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria, which form plaque, than is sorbitol, a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products.   The study suggested ways of modifying the Naturlose product to effect desired plaque reduction.   Such modifications have been made, and the Company has arranged with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct a trial of Naturlose toothpaste formulated by the Company in an attempt to establish an anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis claim for the toothpaste.   The clinical trial started in early 2007.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Direct cost and   operating expense                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, decreased $1.1 million (14%) and $1.7 million (12%) from the same periods in 2006 due to the completion of the National Park Service contract, which concluded on January 23, 2007.   Reductions from the direct costs associated with the National Park Service Contract were off-set by increased costs under the new Michigan contract and additional costs incurred under the contracts transferred from the former South Dakota facility to the new facility in Indiana.   The National Park Service contract contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.    Liquidity and Capital Resources, Consolidated    On June 25, 2007, as part of the Definitive Purchase Agreement to sell InfoSpherix, the Company agreed to terminate the InfoSpherix line-of-credit with Bank of America (  the Bank  ) prior to closing.   Accordingly, the Company subsequently closed the line-of-credit with the Bank.   The InfoSpherix bank line-of-credit was established on March 31, 2006.   The line-of-credit provided for borrowings up to $1.5 million, was collateralized by the subsidiary  s accounts receivables and equipment, and contained covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to EBITDA ratios.   The interest rate under the Agreement was based on the LIBOR daily floating rate plus 3% (approximately 8.5% at June 30, 2007).   The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement at June 30, 2007, and the total amount available for future advances to the subsidiary was $1.5 million under the Agreement.    Working capital as of June 30, 2007, was $7.8 million, which represents a $3.1 million decrease from working capital of $10.9 million at December 31, 2006.   The decrease in working capital was largely related to the Company  s Phase 3 clinical trial costs and increased costs related to the anticipated sale of InfoSpherix.    Spherix expects to expend up to $5 million over the next year in costs related to the Phase 3 clinical trial and other R&amp D activity.   The clinical trial is expected to take at least two years to complete.   The Company intends to finance the BioSpherix activities through proceeds from the sale of the InfoSpherix subsidiary and proceeds from possible future issuance of additional common stock.   The Company also intends to seek pharmaceutical partners to assist in completing development of the BioSpherix products.    Cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2007, reflects a net cash outflow of $2.8 million, consisting of $2.4 million used in operating activities, $1.2 million used in investing activities, and $768,000 provided by financing activities.   The increase in cash used by operating activities in 2007 from that of the prior year is primarily related to the cost of the Phase 3 clinical trial.   The change in cash used in investing activities is related to one-time proceeds of $2 million from the maturity of a certificate of deposit in the prior year.   Cash flows from financing activities in 2006 included proceeds from the issuance of warrants.                      Trends and Outlooks       On June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval, for $17 million ($15 million at closing and $2 million following a 15-month escrow period).   The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division  s biotechnology products.    BioSpherix  s primary emphasis is on a Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate that Naturlose is a successful treatment for Type 2 diabetes.   The trial began in April 2007, and testing is scheduled to finish in mid-2009.   If the trial is successful, it will likely take several months to compile the data and submit a new drug application (  NDA  ) to the FDA.   The FDA will then likely take up to a year to respond to the NDA.   Accordingly, we do not expect FDA approval before mid-to-late 2010 at the earliest.    The Company has decided to conduct the entire Phase 3 clinical trial for Type 2 diabetes in the United States and according has terminating the Australian trials. The change is intended to simplify the logistics of managing the trial.    Costs of conducting the Phase 3 trial have substantially increased as we have obtained further direction from the FDA concerning the processes to be employed in the trial.   The Company expects to spend up to $5 million in R&amp D costs over the next year.   The Company intends to use the proceeds from the sale of the InfoSpherix subsidiary to fund the Phase 3 trial.   If the sale is not concluded, the Company will need to reassess continuation of the tests in view of the increased costs of the tests and the expected follow-on costs in pursuit of FDA approval.    A human clinical trial on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of Naturlose was conducted by the Company at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry.   The trial started in early 2007 and was completed in July.   The Company expects to receive the results later this year.    Spherix has subsequently launched a health sciences consulting business line to provide technical and regulatory consulting services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.       As noted above, on June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval, for $17 million ($15 million at closing and $2 million following a 15-month escrow period).    The Company concluded the National Park Service contract on January 23, 2007.   The National Park Service contract contributed approximately $4 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.   The loss of the National Park Service contract will have an adverse effect on the Company  s financial results in comparison to the prior year.    Since 1998, InfoSpherix has grown its government park reservation business from one contract to 17 government reservation contracts.   InfoSpherix  s reservation business accounted for over 60% of the Company  s revenue in 2006 and 2005, and over 50% for the three months ended March 31, 2007.   InfoSpherix is now one of only two major suppliers of Government campground reservation services in the U.S.    On February 6, 2007, InfoSpherix signed an agreement to lease 32,423 square feet of facility space in Frostburg, Maryland effective December 1, 2007, for use as a call center to replace the existing Cumberland, Maryland facility.    In August 2007, InfoSpherix signed a ten-year lease to rent 13,338 square feet of facility space in Clarksburg, Maryland, for use as an administrative office for InfoSpherix.   The target commencement date for the new lease is November 1, 2007.   In connection with the signing of the above lease, Spherix also signed a lease termination agreement on its Beltsville facility.   Under the lease termination agreement, Spherix will pay a termination fee of $475,000 and the termination date is to be effective with the commencement of the Clarksburg lease.    The Company will cease to have any continuing obligations under the Frostburg, Maryland, or Clarksburg, Maryland, leases upon completion of the sale of InfoSpherix.   The Company will relocate to a smaller facility upon termination of the Beltsville lease.                Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    The Company manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies.    At June 30, 2007, the Company did not have any fixed-rate or variable-rate indebtedness.   The Company has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness.    Cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds, which generally mature in 30 days, or money-market funds.   In general, such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.   The carrying amounts approximate market value.   It is the Company  s practice to hold these investments to maturity.    Assuming the June 30, 2007, variable rate debt and cash and cash available for investment, a one-percent change in interest rates would impact net interest income by less than $100,000.    Item 4.   Controls and Procedures    Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports, such as this report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC  s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. These controls and procedures are based closely on the definition of   disclosure controls and procedures   in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act.  Rules adopted by the SEC require that we present the conclusions of the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.    Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.   Management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.   These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.   Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management  s override of the control.   The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.   Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.    Periodic Evaluation and Conclusion.     The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company  s management, including the Company  s Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company  s disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objective pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company  s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level.   There were no significant changes in internal controls during the latest quarter over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting.                Part II.   Other Information    Item 1a.   Risk Factors    In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,   Item 1A Risk Factors   in our Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2006, and those included in the Company  s Proxy Statement for the August 15, 2007 annual meeting, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

June           the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix Incorporated subsidiary    InfoSpherix     subject to shareholder approval    Accordingly  the operations of InfoSpherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations  and the assets held for sale of the discontinued segment are separately identified in the Company  s Consolidated Balance Sheet    The activities of the   BioSpherix   Division continue to operate through Spherix Incorporated     The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are unaudited and do not include all of the information and disclosures generally required for annual financial statements    In the opinion of management  the statements contain all material adjustments  consisting of normal recurring accruals  necessary to present fairly the Company  s financial position as of June           the results of its operations for the three month and six month periods ended June          and       and its cash flows for the six month periods ended June          and         This report should be read in conjunction with the Company  s Annual Report on Form    K  which does contain the complete information and disclosure for the year ended December              Use of Estimates and Assumptions    The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America    This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period    Accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions     Discontinued Operations    On June           the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary  subject to shareholder approval    The InfoSpherix segment comprises the majority of the Company  s operations    The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division  s biotechnology products  with the principal focus on the commercialization of Naturlose    The sale is subject to the approval of the Company  s stockholders and  if ratified  must be completed within two days of the Company  s August          annual meeting        Spherix employed a business model for many years where it operated two separate lines of business    InfoSpherix and BioSpherix    In accordance with the business plan  InfoSpherix earned enough money to support itself and BioSpherix    This allowed InfoSpherix to grow while supplying funds for the research and development efforts of the BioSpherix Division  which focused on developing healthcare related products     By mid       management believed that this model would soon have to change    The product mix in InfoSpherix was shifting away from the commercial sector to a less profitable government sector    Clients were beginning to require that the Company fund the upfront costs for information projects and recover the cost over the life of the project    Also  our BioSpherix products were far enough along where continued development would soon require significant capital    In addition  equity investors interested in BioSpherix did not understand InfoSpherix and its purpose    Therefore  responsible investors were more difficult to attract    Our InfoSpherix clients became concerned about our focus on this business and they questioned our long term commitment to the business    Also  our bank stated that it was not interested in funding biotechnology research    Therefore  they required the Company to secure its line of credit with cash in lieu of receivables and other fixed assets    Financing for capital equipment was becoming harder to attract    As a result  at the February          meeting  the Board of Directors decided it was time to split the two divisions and require each one to be self funding    On June          the stockholders approved the establishment of InfoSpherix Incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Spherix    Subsequently  on January          InfoSpherix began operating as an independent subsidiary                 In December       the FDA gave Spherix final permission to conduct a Phase   clinical trial for Naturlose as a treatment for Type   diabetes    The Company signed agreements with independent contract research organizations to conduct the Phase   trial and engaged another entity to assist in the development and monitoring of the trials and to consult on FDA issues    Although initial estimates developed by Spherix and the above consultants indicated we had sufficient capital to complete the trial  the Board and management became concerned about long term financing    A manufacturing source needed to be found and  should complications develop in our Phase   trial  final FDA approval of the protocol could result in significant additional capital needs    In addition  it was becoming clear that InfoSpherix also needed capital to develop next generation products     In the spring of       Active Network approached the Company expressing an interest in the reservation portion of the InfoSpherix business and the Company held some preliminary discussion with the Active Network during the next few months    On June           a meeting of the Executive Advisory Committee of the Board was held in Cumberland  Maryland    The Committee discussed a potential sale of all or part of the InfoSpherix subsidiary  along with the use of funds from this sale and any settlement of our National Park Service dispute    The Committee agreed that it was premature to make a decision as to whether any sale of InfoSpherix was desirable    However  the Committee decided that if a sale was ever to be pursued  a sale of the entire subsidiary was preferential and that other potential buyers should be sought     On November           the Company received a letter through its FDA consultant requiring additional expenditures on its Phase   clinical trial    At this point it was becoming apparent that the Phase   trial was going to be more expensive than first thought     Also on November           the Company received an unsolicited Letter of Intent  LOI  from Active Network    The LOI was for the purchase of the entire information business    The Board met on November             After review of the LOI from The Active Network  the Board declined the offer    Discussions were held on the need to raise more capital  even with the    million settlement related to the National Park Service    The rising cost of the Phase   trial was discussed along with the need to complete the anti plaque study of Naturlose at the University of Maryland    Several methods of raising capital were discussed  but no final decision was made     A special Board Meeting was held on January            The immediate need to raise capital was discussed and the President was authorized to seek equity funding for        million to fund the BioSpherix Division    In addition  further discussions were held to consider the possibility of selling InfoSpherix as a means of raising cash     SC amp H Capital Corporation    SC amp H     a consulting firm with merger and acquisition experience  was engaged on January           to assist the management team in exploring a sale of InfoSpherix    On March          the Board of Directors created an Evaluation Committee consisting of three outside directors appointed to provide SC amp H with guidance in the process and to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest     During the first several months of       the President met with several investment bankers about the possibility of raising capital    It was decided that  given the current stock price and early phase of the Phase   clinical trial  an equity offering would not be prudent at this time     On April           a Board Meeting was held to review the capital raising alternatives    In the course of reviewing these alternatives  SC amp H reviewed the process it had conducted with management to that point    Contact had been made with approximately     companies  including both strategic and financial targets  through the use of a blind profile which outlined the InfoSpherix opportunity    This campaign ultimately resulted in approximately    management presentations provided to various interested parties    The above activities yielded four Letters of Intent  including a revised offer from The Active Network    One of the Letters of Intent was ultimately withdrawn    SC amp H prepared a comparison of each of the Letters of Intent and presented it to the Evaluation Committee    A discussion of the possible terms and requirements of a deal ensued     Pursuant to a recommendation from the Evaluation Committee  the Board concluded that a sale of InfoSpherix was in the best interests of Spherix and the Board approved a resolution to accept the offer from Active Network as proposed    The Evaluation Committee was given the authority to approve any changes to the LOI consistent with the discussions                 Subsequent negotiations  led by the management team and outside counsel  were held with The Active Network and on April           a final LOI was signed    Detailed due diligence has been conducted by Active Network and a definitive purchase agreement was executed on June             The sale is subject to the approval of the Company  s stockholders and  if ratified  must be completed

square feet of facility space in Clarksburg  Maryland  for use as an administrative office for InfoSpherix    The target commencement date for the new lease is November            In connection with the signing of the above lease  Spherix also signed a lease termination agreement on its Beltsville facility    Under the lease termination agreement  Spherix will pay a termination fee of          and the termination date is to be effective with the commencement of the Clarksburg lease     On June           as part of the Definitive Purchase Agreement to sell InfoSpherix  the Company agreed to terminate the InfoSpherix line of credit with Bank of America    the Bank    prior to closing    Accordingly  the Company has subsequently closed the line of credit with the Bank    The InfoSpherix bank line of credit was established on March             The line of credit provided for borrowings up to      million  was collateralized by the subsidiary  s accounts receivables and equipment  and contained covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to EBITDA ratios    The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement at June           and at the time of termination     Item      Management  s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    The following is intended to update the information contained in the Company  s Annual Report on Form    K for the year ended December           and presumes that readers have access to  and will have read    Management  s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   contained in such Form    K     Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form    Q may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section   A of the Securities Act of      and Section   E of the Securities Exchange Act of      and are identified by the use of forward looking words or phrases such as   believes      expects    is or are   expected      anticipates      anticipated      should   and words of similar impact    These forward looking statements are based on the Company  s current expectations    Because forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  the Company  s actual results could differ materially    See the Company  s Form   K filing dated March           for a more detailed statement concerning forward looking statements        The Company operates via two principal segments  BioSpherix and InfoSpherix    BioSpherix develops proprietary products for commercial applications    InfoSpherix provides contact center information and reservation services for government and industry  with substantially all of InfoSpherix revenue generated from government customers                 BioSpherix engages in product development  notably tagatose    The Company  s current focus is on the non food use of tagatose  which we will market under the name   Naturlose      Our principal efforts have been to explore whether Naturlose is an effective treatment for Type   diabetes    In April       the Company commenced a Phase   trial for this purpose     InfoSpherix has developed a niche in providing campground and other reservation services via its ReserveWorld business line and is one of only two major suppliers of campground reservation services in the U S    Reservation contracts make up over     of the Company  s revenue    The reservation services contracts have revenue streams that are historically greater in the spring and summer months when vacation planning is more prevalent    These reservation contracts have certain fixed costs that continue throughout the year such as depreciation  telephone and computer related service and maintenance contracts  and minimum staffing requirements    These contracts also incur certain costs in advance of the peak seasons in order to staff up and train the work force that will be needed during the peak seasons    On January           the Company concluded its long standing National Park Service contract    The National Park Service contract contributed approximately      million in revenue for each of the years ended December          and          On June           the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary  subject to shareholder approval    The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division  s biotechnology products  with the principal focus on the commercialization of Naturlose    The sale is subject to the approval of the Company  s stockholders and  if ratified  must be completed within two days of the Company  s August          annual meeting     The operations of InfoSpherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations     Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June          and         Selling  General and Administrative    Selling  general and administrative expenses  S G amp A  for the three and six months ended June           increased          and          over those of the same periods in         The increase in the second quarter was primarily the result of an executive bonus of          awarded to the CEO for past performance  and an increase in accounting costs of approximately          related to the increased complexity of the Company  s tax reporting requirements including the implementation of FIN       The increase in S G amp A costs for the six months ended June          over those of the prior year also included approximately          in costs related to the services of an investment banker prior to the Company  s decision to sell InfoSpherix    Excluded from the above S G amp A numbers is approximately          in consulting and legal costs related to the sale of InfoSpherix that have been classified as part of the costs of the discontinued operations    These costs were incurred in the second quarter of       following the decision to sell InfoSpherix     Research and Development    The Company  s R amp D expenditures have significantly increased between years as a direct result of the Company  s Phase   clinical trial in the use of Naturlose for the treatment of Type   diabetes  which began this year    The primary focus of BioSpherix  s research and development  R amp D  activities for the six months ended June           has been on the planning and preparation of a Phase   trial    The Company has completed an initial dose range finding study  and the recruitment of patients for the trial  which will take place in Australia and the United States  is ongoing    The first participants began the Phase   clinical trial in April         More than     subjects from the United States and abroad  representing the demographic mix in the U S   will receive oral doses of Naturlose to test its ability to treat Type   diabetes    A Phase   clinical trial  which gathers evidence regarding effectiveness and safety  is needed to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of new drugs proposed to the FDA    The Company believes its chances for a successful outcome are enhanced by the widely demonstrated safety of the product  lack of safety being the primary cause for failure of most drug candidates    Testing is scheduled to finish in mid         If the trial is successful  it will likely take several months to compile the data and submit a new drug application    NDA    to the FDA    The FDA will then likely take up to a year to respond to the NDA    Accordingly  we do not expect FDA approval before mid      at the earliest                 In       the Company contracted with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct a human clinical trial on the oral anti plaque efficacy of Naturlose    The study demonstrated tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria  which form plaque  than is sorbitol  a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products    The study suggested ways of modifying the Naturlose product to effect desired plaque reduction    Such modifications have been made  and the Company has arranged with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct a trial of Naturlose toothpaste formulated by the Company in an attempt to establish an anti plaque and anti gingivitis claim for the toothpaste    The clinical trial started in early                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Direct cost and   operating expense                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Revenue for the three and six months ended June           decreased      million       and      million       from the same periods in      due to the completion of the National Park Service contract  which concluded on January             Reductions from the direct costs associated with the National Park Service Contract were off set by increased costs under the new Michigan contract and additional costs incurred under the contracts transferred from the former South Dakota facility to the new facility in Indiana    The National Park Service contract contributed approximately      million in revenue for each of the years ended December          and          Liquidity and Capital Resources  Consolidated    On June           as part of the Definitive Purchase Agreement to sell InfoSpherix  the Company agreed to terminate the InfoSpherix line of credit with Bank of America    the Bank    prior to closing    Accordingly  the Company subsequently closed the line of credit with the Bank    The InfoSpherix bank line of credit was established on March             The line of credit provided for borrowings up to      million  was collateralized by the subsidiary  s accounts receivables and equipment  and contained covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to EBITDA ratios    The interest rate under the Agreement was based on the LIBOR daily floating rate plus     approximately      at June              The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement at June           and the total amount available for future advances to the subsidiary was      million under the Agreement     Working capital as of June           was      million  which represents a      million decrease from working capital of       million at December             The decrease in working capital was largely related to the Company  s Phase   clinical trial costs and increased costs related to the anticipated sale of InfoSpherix     Spherix expects to expend up to    million over the next year in costs related to the Phase   clinical trial and other R amp D activity    The clinical trial is expected to take at least two years to complete    The Company intends to finance the BioSpherix activities through proceeds from the sale of the InfoSpherix subsidiary and proceeds from possible future issuance of additional common stock    The Company also intends to seek pharmaceutical partners to assist in completing development of the BioSpherix products     Cash flow for the six months ended June           reflects a net cash outflow of      million  consisting of      million used in operating activities       million used in investing activities  and          provided by financing activities    The increase in cash used by operating activities in      from that of the prior year is primarily related to the cost of the Phase   clinical trial    The change in cash used in investing activities is related to one time proceeds of    million from the maturity of a certificate of deposit in the prior year    Cash flows from financing activities in      included proceeds from the issuance of warrants                       Trends and Outlooks       On June           the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary  subject to shareholder approval  for     million      million at closing and    million following a    month escrow period     The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division  s biotechnology products     BioSpherix  s primary emphasis is on a Phase   clinical trial to demonstrate that Naturlose is a successful treatment for Type   diabetes    The trial began in April       and testing is scheduled to finish in mid         If the trial is successful  it will likely take several months to compile the data and submit a new drug application    NDA    to the FDA    The FDA will then likely take up to a year to respond to the NDA    Accordingly  we do not expect FDA approval before mid to late      at the earliest     The Company has decided to conduct the entire Phase   clinical trial for Type   diabetes in the United States and according has terminating the Australian trials  The change is intended to simplify the logistics of managing the trial     Costs of conducting the Phase   trial have substantially increased as we have obtained further direction from the FDA concerning the processes to be employed in the trial    The Company expects to spend up to    million in R amp D costs over the next year    The Company intends to use the proceeds from the sale of the InfoSpherix subsidiary to fund the Phase   trial    If the sale is not concluded  the Company will need to reassess continuation of the tests in view of the increased costs of the tests and the expected follow on costs in pursuit of FDA approval     A human clinical trial on the oral anti plaque efficacy of Naturlose was conducted by the Company at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry    The trial started in early      and was completed in July    The Company expects to receive the results later this year     Spherix has subsequently launched a health sciences consulting business line to provide technical and regulatory consulting services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies        As noted above  on June           the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary  subject to shareholder approval  for     million      million at closing and    million following a    month escrow period      The Company concluded the National Park Service contract on January             The National Park Service contract contributed approximately    million in revenue for each of the years ended December          and         The loss of the National Park Service contract will have an adverse effect on the Company  s financial results in comparison to the prior year     Since       InfoSpherix has grown its government park reservation business from one contract to    government reservation contracts    InfoSpherix  s reservation business accounted for over     of the Company  s revenue in      and       and over     for the three months ended March             InfoSpherix is now one of only two major suppliers of Government campground reservation services in the U S     On February          InfoSpherix signed an agreement to lease        square feet of facility space in Frostburg  Maryland effective December          for use as a call center to replace the existing Cumberland  Maryland facility     In August       InfoSpherix signed a ten year lease to rent        square feet of facility space in Clarksburg  Maryland  for use as an administrative office for InfoSpherix    The target commencement date for the new lease is November            In connection with the signing of the above lease  Spherix also signed a lease termination agreement on its Beltsville facility    Under the lease termination agreement  Spherix will pay a termination fee of          and the termination date is to be effective with the commencement of the Clarksburg lease     The Company will cease to have any continuing obligations under the Frostburg  Maryland  or Clarksburg  Maryland  leases upon completion of the sale of InfoSpherix    The Company will relocate to a smaller facility upon termination of the Beltsville lease                 Item      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    The Company manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies     At June           the Company did not have any fixed rate or variable rate indebtedness    The Company has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness     Cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds  which generally mature in    days  or money market funds    In general  such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate    The carrying amounts approximate market value    It is the Company  s practice to hold these investments to maturity     Assuming the June           variable rate debt and cash and cash available for investment  a one percent change in interest rates would impact net interest income by less than              Item      Controls and Procedures    Disclosure Controls and Procedures    We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports  such as this report on Form    Q  is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC  s rules and forms  and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including our Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure  These controls and procedures are based closely on the definition of   disclosure controls and procedures   in Rule   a    e  promulgated under the Exchange Act   Rules adopted by the SEC require that we present the conclusions of the Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report     Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls    Management  including our Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer  do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud   In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures  management recognized that any controls and procedures  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance of achieving the desired control objectives   Further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures   Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the Company have been detected    These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake    Additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management  s override of the control    The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions    Over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate    Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected     Periodic Evaluation and Conclusion      The Company carried out an evaluation  under the supervision and with the participation of the Company  s management  including the Company  s Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer  of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company  s disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objective pursuant to Exchange Act Rule   a     Based upon that evaluation  the Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company  s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level    There were no significant changes in internal controls during the latest quarter over financial reporting that

june           the company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the infospherix incorporated subsidiary    infospherix     subject to shareholder approval    accordingly  the operations of infospherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations  and the assets held for sale of the discontinued segment are separately identified in the company  s consolidated balance sheet    the activities of the   biospherix   division continue to operate through spherix incorporated     the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the company are unaudited and do not include all of the information and disclosures generally required for annual financial statements    in the opinion of management  the statements contain all material adjustments  consisting of normal recurring accruals  necessary to present fairly the company  s financial position as of june           the results of its operations for the three month and six month periods ended june          and       and its cash flows for the six month periods ended june          and         this report should be read in conjunction with the company  s annual report on form    k  which does contain the complete information and disclosure for the year ended december              use of estimates and assumptions    the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america    this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period    accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions     discontinued operations    on june           the company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the infospherix subsidiary  subject to shareholder approval    the infospherix segment comprises the majority of the company  s operations    the sale will allow spherix to focus all of its efforts on the biospherix division  s biotechnology products  with the principal focus on the commercialization of naturlose    the sale is subject to the approval of the company  s stockholders and  if ratified  must be completed within two days of the company  s august          annual meeting        spherix employed a business model for many years where it operated two separate lines of business    infospherix and biospherix    in accordance with the business plan  infospherix earned enough money to support itself and biospherix    this allowed infospherix to grow while supplying funds for the research and development efforts of the biospherix division  which focused on developing healthcare related products     by mid       management believed that this model would soon have to change    the product mix in infospherix was shifting away from the commercial sector to a less profitable government sector    clients were beginning to require that the company fund the upfront costs for information projects and recover the cost over the life of the project    also  our biospherix products were far enough along where continued development would soon require significant capital    in addition  equity investors interested in biospherix did not understand infospherix and its purpose    therefore  responsible investors were more difficult to attract    our infospherix clients became concerned about our focus on this business and they questioned our long term commitment to the business    also  our bank stated that it was not interested in funding biotechnology research    therefore  they required the company to secure its line of credit with cash in lieu of receivables and other fixed assets    financing for capital equipment was becoming harder to attract    as a result  at the february          meeting  the board of directors decided it was time to split the two divisions and require each one to be self funding    on june          the stockholders approved the establishment of infospherix incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of spherix    subsequently  on january          infospherix began operating as an independent subsidiary                 in december       the fda gave spherix final permission to conduct a phase   clinical trial for naturlose as a treatment for type   diabetes    the company signed agreements with independent contract research organizations to conduct the phase   trial and engaged another entity to assist in the development and monitoring of the trials and to consult on fda issues    although initial estimates developed by spherix and the above consultants indicated we had sufficient capital to complete the trial  the board and management became concerned about long term financing    a manufacturing source needed to be found and  should complications develop in our phase   trial  final fda approval of the protocol could result in significant additional capital needs    in addition  it was becoming clear that infospherix also needed capital to develop next generation products     in the spring of       active network approached the company expressing an interest in the reservation portion of the infospherix business and the company held some preliminary discussion with the active network during the next few months    on june           a meeting of the executive advisory committee of the board was held in cumberland  maryland    the committee discussed a potential sale of all or part of the infospherix subsidiary  along with the use of funds from this sale and any settlement of our national park service dispute    the committee agreed that it was premature to make a decision as to whether any sale of infospherix was desirable    however  the committee decided that if a sale was ever to be pursued  a sale of the entire subsidiary was preferential and that other potential buyers should be sought     on november           the company received a letter through its fda consultant requiring additional expenditures on its phase   clinical trial    at this point it was becoming apparent that the phase   trial was going to be more expensive than first thought     also on november           the company received an unsolicited letter of intent  loi  from active network    the loi was for the purchase of the entire information business    the board met on november             after review of the loi from the active network  the board declined the offer    discussions were held on the need to raise more capital  even with the    million settlement related to the national park service    the rising cost of the phase   trial was discussed along with the need to complete the anti plaque study of naturlose at the university of maryland    several methods of raising capital were discussed  but no final decision was made     a special board meeting was held on january            the immediate need to raise capital was discussed and the president was authorized to seek equity funding for        million to fund the biospherix division    in addition  further discussions were held to consider the possibility of selling infospherix as a means of raising cash     sc amp h capital corporation    sc amp h     a consulting firm with merger and acquisition experience  was engaged on january           to assist the management team in exploring a sale of infospherix    on march          the board of directors created an evaluation committee consisting of three outside directors appointed to provide sc amp h with guidance in the process and to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest     during the first several months of       the president met with several investment bankers about the possibility of raising capital    it was decided that  given the current stock price and early phase of the phase   clinical trial  an equity offering would not be prudent at this time     on april           a board meeting was held to review the capital raising alternatives    in the course of reviewing these alternatives  sc amp h reviewed the process it had conducted with management to that point    contact had been made with approximately     companies  including both strategic and financial targets  through the use of a blind profile which outlined the infospherix opportunity    this campaign ultimately resulted in approximately    management presentations provided to various interested parties    the above activities yielded four letters of intent  including a revised offer from the active network    one of the letters of intent was ultimately withdrawn    sc amp h prepared a comparison of each of the letters of intent and presented it to the evaluation committee    a discussion of the possible terms and requirements of a deal ensued     pursuant to a recommendation from the evaluation committee  the board concluded that a sale of infospherix was in the best interests of spherix and the board approved a resolution to accept the offer from active network as proposed    the evaluation committee was given the authority to approve any changes to the loi consistent with the discussions                 subsequent negotiations  led by the management team and outside counsel  were held with the active network and on april           a final loi was signed    detailed due diligence has been conducted by active network and a definitive purchase agreement was executed on june             the sale is subject to the approval of the company  s stockholders and  if ratified  must be completed

costs to sell the segment  are as follows

operates via two principal segments  biospherix and infospherix    biospherix develops proprietary products for commercial applications    infospherix provides contact center information and reservation services for government and industry  with substantially all of infospherix revenue generated from government customers                 biospherix engages in product development  notably tagatose    the company  s current focus is on the non food use of tagatose  which we will market under the name   naturlose      our principal efforts have been to explore whether naturlose is an effective treatment for type   diabetes    in april       the company commenced a phase   trial for this purpose     infospherix has developed a niche in providing campground and other reservation services via its reserveworld business line and is one of only two major suppliers of campground reservation services in the u s    reservation contracts make up over     of the company  s revenue    the reservation services contracts have revenue streams that are historically greater in the spring and summer months when vacation planning is more prevalent    these reservation contracts have certain fixed costs that continue throughout the year such as depreciation  telephone and computer related service and maintenance contracts  and minimum staffing requirements    these contracts also incur certain costs in advance of the peak seasons in order to staff up and train the work force that will be needed during the peak seasons    on january           the company concluded its long standing national park service contract    the national park service contract contributed approximately      million in revenue for each of the years ended december          and          on june           the company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the infospherix subsidiary  subject to shareholder approval    the sale will allow spherix to focus all of its efforts on the biospherix division  s biotechnology products  with the principal focus on the commercialization of naturlose    the sale is subject to the approval of the company  s stockholders and  if ratified  must be completed within two days of the company  s august          annual meeting     the operations of infospherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations

months ended june           increased          and          over those of the same periods in         the increase in the second quarter was primarily the result of an executive bonus of          awarded to the ceo for past performance  and an increase in accounting costs of approximately          related to the increased complexity of the company  s tax reporting requirements including the implementation of fin       the increase in s g amp a costs for the six months ended june          over those of the prior year also included approximately          in costs related to the services of an investment banker prior to the company  s decision to sell infospherix    excluded from the above s g amp a numbers is approximately          in consulting and legal costs related to the sale of infospherix that have been classified as part of the costs of the discontinued operations    these costs were incurred in the second quarter of       following the decision to sell infospherix     research and development    the company  s r amp d expenditures have significantly increased between years as a direct result of the company  s phase   clinical trial in the use of naturlose for the treatment of type   diabetes  which began this year    the primary focus of biospherix  s research and development  r amp d  activities for the six months ended june           has been on the planning and preparation of a phase   trial    the company has completed an initial dose range finding study  and the recruitment of patients for the trial  which will take place in australia and the united states  is ongoing    the first participants began the phase   clinical trial in april         more than     subjects from the united states and abroad  representing the demographic mix in the u s   will receive oral doses of naturlose to test its ability to treat type   diabetes    a phase   clinical trial  which gathers evidence regarding effectiveness and safety  is needed to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of new drugs proposed to the fda    the company believes its chances for a successful outcome are enhanced by the widely demonstrated safety of the product  lack of safety being the primary cause for failure of most drug candidates    testing is scheduled to finish in mid         if the trial is successful  it will likely take several months to compile the data and submit a new drug application    nda    to the fda    the fda will then likely take up to a year to respond to the nda    accordingly  we do not expect fda approval before mid      at the earliest                 in       the company contracted with the university of maryland school of dentistry to conduct a human clinical trial on the oral anti plaque efficacy of naturlose    the study demonstrated tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria  which form plaque  than is sorbitol  a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products    the study suggested ways of modifying the naturlose product to effect desired plaque reduction    such modifications have been made  and the company has arranged with the university of maryland school of dentistry to conduct a trial of naturlose toothpaste formulated by the company in an attempt to establish an anti plaque and anti gingivitis claim for the toothpaste    the clinical trial started in early

    and      million       from the same periods in      due to the completion of the national park service contract  which concluded on january             reductions from the direct costs associated with the national park service contract were off set by increased costs under the new michigan contract and additional costs incurred under the contracts transferred from the former south dakota

represents a      million decrease from working capital of       million at december             the decrease in working capital was largely related to the company  s phase   clinical trial costs and increased costs related to the anticipated sale of infospherix     spherix expects to expend up to    million over the next year in costs related to the phase   clinical trial and other r amp d activity    the clinical trial is expected to take at least two years to complete    the company intends to finance the biospherix activities through proceeds from the sale of the infospherix
